Turing-Machine
==============

- simple console based turing machine written in C++ using MS Visual Studio
- to test it, simply open the turing_machine.sln file using Visual Studio or copy the .h and .cpp files into your prefered IDE.
- entry point is the main function in turing.cpp
- for demonstration I included some test TMs in turing.cpp (unary increment, binary decrement, unary addition and subtraction)
